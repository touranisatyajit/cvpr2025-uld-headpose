# Unsupervised Discovery of Facial Landmarks and Head Pose (CVPR 2025) 

Our contributions are summarized as follows:
  - We develop a new semantic-aware landmark localization algorithm, which features a novel landmark consistency evaluation technique.
  - We propose learning image-aware textual embedding to capture entire facial structure in the form of landmarks and their configuration.
  - We propose an unsupervised landmark-guided 3D head pose estimation algorithm which sets a new baseline in the unsupervised domain.
  - We present a novel 3D rendering-based augmentation and pose-based batching technique to further refine landmarks and consequently improve head-pose estimation especially across extreme facial orientations.
  - Our approach sets a new stateof-the-art in unsupervised facial landmark estimation across five public datasets: AFLW2000, MAFL, Cat-Heads, LS3D and a facial landmark tracking benchmark 300VW.
